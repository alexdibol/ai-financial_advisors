# AI for Financial Advisors

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **AI for Financial Advisors**, an educational, governance-first guide for **U.S. wealth management and financial advice**.

It is designed to help RIAs/IARs, broker-dealer representatives, planners, and wealth management leaders develop a clear mental model of what generative AI can do **today**, where it introduces new risks, and how it can be used responsibly under **fiduciary duty, Reg BI, supervision, recordkeeping, privacy, and client-communication** constraints.

The focus is not speed, automation, or “AI recommendations,” but **client protection, professional defensibility, traceability, and supervision-ready evidence**.

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as an authority**, but as a drafting and reasoning tool whose usefulness depends on **controls, verification, and accountability**.

It introduces a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual productivity to organization-grade advisory operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting of client emails, meeting follow-ups, summaries, and internal notes  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** structured fact-finding, suitability and Reg BI reasoning scaffolds, scenario comparison, and gap detection  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows with human checkpoints (intake → IPS draft → disclosure checklist → review packet) and immutable logs  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable, tested AI assets such as playbooks, templates, supervision workflows, and evaluation harnesses  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** a full operating model covering intake, KYC/KYB structuring, suitability and best-interest checks, QA, approval routing, recordkeeping and audit bundles, monitoring, and retrieval  

At every level, **facts are separated from assumptions**, and all outputs default to **“Not verified.”**

## Independent pedagogical evaluation by OpenAI-ChatGPT (MBA / MFin)
This book has **exceptionally high pedagogical value** for MBA and MFin students when the **author is also the instructor**, because it functions as a fully integrated teaching system rather than a standalone text.

The five-level maturity ladder provides a clear managerial mental model: as AI capability increases, governance, controls, and accountability must increase in parallel. The companion Google Colab notebooks reinforce this by requiring students to produce supervision-ready artifacts—run manifests, prompt logs, risk registers, and draft deliverables—shifting learning away from “AI outputs” toward **defensible advisory process design**.

The recurring mini-cases allow students to revisit the same advisory scenarios with increasing rigor, creating a strong spiral curriculum in judgment, client protection, suitability and best-interest discipline, and operating-model design. Because the instructor authored the framework, expectations, grading criteria, and professional discipline can be enforced consistently, reducing ambiguity and superficial AI use.

Overall, the book excels at teaching **how advisors and managers should govern AI in regulated advice**, not merely how to use it.

**Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)**

## What makes this governance-first (and why that matters in advice)
The focus is client protection and supervision readiness. Each chapter emphasizes controls that make AI-assisted work safer to review and harder to misuse:

- Explicit separation of **generation vs. verification**  
- Clear labeling of **facts provided, assumptions, open items, risks, and conflicts**  
- No invented product terms, fees, tax consequences, performance claims, or authoritative citations  
- Governance-native artifacts: run manifests, prompt logs, risk logs, versioned deliverables, and reviewer sign-offs  
- Human advisor review required for any client-facing or reliance-bearing output  
- Recordkeeping discipline: preserve prompts and outputs when used for client communications or supervised workflows  

These controls align with real advisory, supervisory, and client-communication expectations.

---

## Recurring mini-cases used across all chapters
Each level is demonstrated using the same four recurring case types:

- **Retirement and distribution planning**  
- **Tax-aware planning and concentrated stock**  
- **Alternatives, illiquids, and liquidity constraints**  
- **Practice management, training, and advisor enablement**  

Each chapter concludes with a **minimum standard checklist** that can be adopted directly in practice.

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not investment, legal, or tax advice**.

All AI-generated outputs must be reviewed and verified by qualified professionals before any client use or reliance-bearing use. Fiduciary duty, Reg BI, confidentiality, supervision, and recordkeeping obligations apply at every level.

Do **not** input sensitive or confidential client information into external AI tools. Use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.
