This traditional chatbot interaction works well for general inquiries, creative writing, or casual research. You ask a question, the AI responds with text, and the conversation flows naturally without any particular structure or documentation. However, this informal approach presents serious challenges in regulated industries like financial services, where every recommendation must be documented, every assumption must be traceable, and every decision must withstand regulatory scrutiny.\n","\n","This notebook represents a fundamentally different approach to working with AI in professional advisory contexts. Instead of casual conversation, it implements what we call structured reasoning with comprehensive governance controls. The difference is profound and addresses the core challenge facing financial advisors who want to leverage AI capabilities while remaining compliant with regulations like Regulation Best Interest, fiduciary standards, and recordkeeping requirements.\n","\n","In a traditional chatbot interaction, you might ask something like \"What should my client do with their concentrated stock position?\" and receive a narrative response discussing various options. The problem is that this response disappears unless you manually copy it somewhere. There's no automatic record of what assumptions the AI made, no documentation of what alternatives were considered, no log of the exact question asked, and no systematic way to verify that the AI didn't cross boundaries by making recommendations that only a qualified human advisor should make. If a regulator later questions your advice, you have no defensible trail showing how you used AI in your process.\n","\n","This notebook solves these problems through four fundamental innovations that transform AI from an uncontrolled conversational tool into a governed reasoning assistant.\n","\n","**First, the notebook enforces strict boundaries through what we call Level Two reasoning.** Traditional chatbots will happily tell you what to recommend, which securities to buy, or whether something is suitable for a client. This notebook's architecture prevents the AI from crossing those lines. It's programmed to separate facts from assumptions, identify alternatives without recommending any particular one, surface questions that need human judgment, and detect gaps in information. The AI acts as a reasoning scaffold that organizes thinking rather than a decision-maker that replaces professional judgment. Every prompt sent to the AI explicitly reinforces these boundaries, and automated risk detection scans responses for language that would indicate the AI overstepped its role.\n","\n","**Second, the notebook creates comprehensive audit trails that make every interaction traceable and defensible.** When you use a traditional chatbot, the conversation happens and then it's gone unless you manually save it. This notebook automatically logs every prompt sent to the AI and every response received, with both redacted to protect confidentiality. Each log entry includes cryptographic hashes that create an immutable chain, meaning any tampering would be immediately detectable. The system also generates a run manifest that documents exactly which AI model was used, what parameters controlled its behavior, and what governance rules were in effect. If you need to demonstrate to a compliance officer or regulator that you used AI appropriately, you can provide the complete bundle showing exactly what happened, when it happened, and under what controls.\n","\n","**Third, the notebook implements systematic risk detection that identifies potential problems in real time.** As the AI generates responses, automated scanners check for recommendation language like \"you should\" or \"I recommend,\" invented authority like fabricated SEC rules or FINRA requirements, missing disclaimers that should appear in every output, insufficient alternatives when multiple options should be presented, and gaps in critical information that would make any analysis incomplete. Each detected risk gets logged with severity ratings, creating a risk register that supervisors can review. This is fundamentally different from hoping you'll notice problems yourself in a casual chat conversation.\n","\n","**Fourth, the notebook produces structured deliverables rather than free-form text.** Instead of getting paragraphs of narrative that you need to interpret and extract value from, the AI returns information in standardized JSON format with specific fields for facts, assumptions, alternatives, open questions, analysis, and risks. This structure ensures consistency across cases, makes information easy to find and review, enables automated quality checks, and creates artifacts that can be directly incorporated into supervision files. The structured format also means you can build workflows where one advisor's reasoning artifacts become inputs for supervisor review or peer consultation.\n","\n","The practical benefits for financial advisory practices are substantial. Imagine an advisor preparing for a client meeting about retirement income planning. In the traditional chatbot approach, the advisor might have several informal conversations with AI, getting various suggestions and ideas, but ending up with nothing documented and no clear separation between the AI's input and the advisor's own professional judgment. With this structured reasoning system, the advisor inputs sanitized client facts, receives back a reasoning map that clearly separates what's known from what's assumed from what's unknown, gets a comparison of alternative approaches without any recommendations, sees questions surfaced about information gaps, and obtains all of this in documented JSON files with full audit trails showing the AI stayed within appropriate boundaries.\n","\n","For compliance officers and supervisors, the benefits are equally compelling. Traditional chatbot usage is nearly impossible to supervise effectively because there's no systematic way to know what advisors asked, what responses they received, or how they used those responses. This notebook produces a complete bundle for every run including the governance manifest showing what rules were in effect, immutable logs of all AI interactions, risk registers flagging potential issues, and structured outputs for each case that can be reviewed against standardized criteria. The supervisor can verify that facts were separated from assumptions, that multiple alternatives were identified, that no recommendations were made, and that all regulatory references were marked as unverified.\n","\n","The importance of this approach extends beyond individual compliance. In regulated industries, the question is not whether professionals will use AI tools, but whether they'll use them in ways that create liability or in ways that enhance quality while maintaining defensibility. Traditional chatbot usage creates hidden risks because it happens in the shadows without documentation, encourages boundary violations because the AI naturally wants to be helpful by making recommendations, provides no systematic quality control, and leaves no trail for supervision or regulatory examination.\n","\n","Structured reasoning with governance controls brings AI usage into the light. It creates transparency through comprehensive logging, enforces appropriate boundaries through architecture rather than hoping users will self-regulate, enables supervision through standardized outputs and risk registers, and produces defensible artifacts that demonstrate responsible use. This transforms AI from a compliance risk into a compliance-positive tool that actually strengthens your documentation and supervision processes.\n","\n","The notebook's approach recognizes a fundamental truth about AI in professional services: the technology is powerful but must be channeled appropriately. Just as financial advisors use sophisticated analytical tools but remain responsible for recommendations, this system lets advisors leverage AI's reasoning capabilities while maintaining clear human accountability. The AI structures information, identifies considerations, and surfaces questions, but the qualified human advisor still makes all judgments about suitability, best interest, and appropriate courses of action.\n","\n","For practices considering AI adoption, this notebook demonstrates that the choice is not between using AI or avoiding it, but between using AI recklessly or using it responsibly. The structured governance approach shown here provides a template for bringing powerful AI capabilities into regulated advisory work without creating the documentation gaps, boundary violations, or supervision challenges that would come from treating AI as just another chatbot to have casual conversations with. This is how professional services can harness transformative technology while honoring the regulatory frameworks that protect investors and maintain market integrity."],"metadata":{"id":"6n-x0MLbMKUs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"HzSSYRQ0MKs8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 2\n","# Goal: Install dependencies, imports, and create run directory structure\n","# Output: Confirmation messages showing setup completion\n","\n","!pip install -q anthropic\n","\n","import anthropic\n","import os\n","import json\n","import hashlib\n","import uuid\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import zipfile\n","\n","# Create run directory structure\n","RUN_ID = f\"run_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}\"\n","RUN_DIR = Path(f\"/content/{RUN_ID}\")\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR = RUN_DIR / \"deliverables\"\n","LOGS_DIR = RUN_DIR / \"logs\"\n","\n","RUN_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","LOGS_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(f\"✓ Dependencies installed\")\n","print(f\"✓ Run directory created: {RUN_DIR}\")\n","print(f\"✓ Run ID: {RUN_ID}\")\n","print(f\"✓ Deliverables: {DELIVERABLES_DIR}\")\n","print(f\"✓ Logs: {LOGS_DIR}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"TOYUwL9vMKKC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768492535817,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":6157,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"84e8d7dd-8f85-4b8e-d408-e4fc902d5a21"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[91m╸\u001b[0m \u001b[32m389.1/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m390.3/390.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h✓ Dependencies installed\n","✓ Run directory created: /content/run_20260115_155535_110b2989\n","✓ Run ID: run_20260115_155535_110b2989\n","✓ Deliverables: /content/run_20260115_155535_110b2989/deliverables\n","✓ Logs: /content/run_20260115_155535_110b2989/logs\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.CLAUDE API AND CLIENT INITIALIZATION"],"metadata":{"id":"STtjBQgwMNHi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"ShWjt_vyMO17"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","When you run Cell 3, the notebook attempts to connect to the Anthropic AI service using your API key.

Every agent must return information in exactly the same JSON format with ten required fields: task description, facts provided, assumptions made, alternatives considered, open questions, analysis notes, risks identified, draft output, verification status, and items needing verification. This standardization ensures consistency across all workflow steps and makes supervision much easier.\n","\n","When any agent calls the AI, this wrapper does several important things automatically. First, it enhances the instructions sent to the AI, explicitly requiring JSON-only responses with strict length limits to prevent truncation problems.

These limits ensure responses complete without being cut off mid-sentence.\n","\n","The wrapper includes sophisticated error handling with retry logic.

Think of this as assembling a team of focused assistants, each with a specific job, along with the shared systems they'll use to coordinate their work.\n","\n","The cell first builds the Logger class, which maintains the tamper-evident audit trail. Every time an agent interacts with the AI, the logger records it with cryptographic hashing. Each new log entry includes a hash of the previous entry, creating a mathematical chain. If anyone tried to alter a past entry, the chain would break, immediately revealing the tampering. This is the same principle used in blockchain technology.\n","\n","Next comes the SharedState class, which acts as the workflow's memory and coordination center. It maintains four critical registers: assumptions made during analysis, open items requiring follow-up, claims needing external verification, and a history of all checkpoint approvals. The state also includes the checkpoint mechanism, which can pause the workflow requiring human review before proceeding. Additionally, it has logic to check for unresolved hinge facts - critical assumptions that must be validated before downstream work continues.\n","\n","The cell then creates six specialized agent classes. The IntakeAgent structures raw client scenarios into organized facts, assumptions, and questions. The IPSDraftAgent generates Investment Policy Statement shells focusing on process and governance without specifying investments. The DisclosureAgent creates checklists of topics advisors should disclose to clients. The SuitabilityReasoningAgent drafts structured questions advisors must answer when evaluating strategies, explicitly avoiding any suitability conclusions. The QCReviewerAgent examines all previous work looking for gaps, inconsistencies, or missing information. Finally, the RiskAssessorAgent evaluates the overall workflow for integrity problems.\n","\n","Each agent is programmed with explicit instructions to keep responses concise and structured. The prompts specify maximum item counts and character limits to prevent the truncation problems encountered earlier. For example, agents are told to list only five to eight key facts, keep analysis to 300-400 characters, and limit draft outputs to 800 characters.\n","\n","The confirmation message lists all loaded

The output includes statistics like how many facts were extracted, assumptions identified, and risks flagged.\n","\n","As the workflow runs, you might see warnings if any issues arise, such as JSON parsing problems or detected risk patterns.

Explanation:\n","\n","Cell 10 packages everything generated during the workflow into a comprehensive, downloadable supervision file. Think of this as creating a complete case binder that a compliance officer or auditor could review to understand exactly what happened during the AI-assisted advisory process.\n","\n","The cell first generates an extensive README document that serves as the cover memo and user guide for the entire package. This README is approximately 5000 words and includes detailed sections explaining what the package contains, what the AI agents did and did not do, governance principles applied, supervision checklists, usage instructions, and technical details about how the system works. The README emphasizes repeatedly that the outputs are not investment advice and require qualified advisor review.\n","\n","Next, the cell creates a package summary JSON file that provides programmatic access to key information. This machine-readable summary includes the run identifier, timestamp, complete manifest, status of each case (completed or failed), file paths for all artifacts, and any error messages. This allows automated tools to process the package without parsing the human-readable README.\n","\n","The cell then gathers statistics from the execution: total number of risks logged, how many were high-severity, total audit log entries, and case completion rates. These metrics provide quick insight into workflow quality and any problems that occurred.\n","\n","All files are then bundled into a single ZIP archive. The compression process recursively walks through the entire run directory, adding every file while preserving the folder structure. The resulting ZIP contains the manifest, README, package summary, immutable logs, risk register, and separate subfolders for each case with their artifacts, registers, and checkpoint histories.\n","\n","The output displays a comprehensive final summary showing execution statistics, package contents inventory, governance artifacts included, demonstrations completed, and reminders about the advisory review requirement. You'll see exact numbers for completed versus failed cases, total log entries, and risks detected.\n","\n","Finally, the cell provides clear download instructions with two options: manually downloading from Colab's file browser, or running a code snippet to trigger automatic download. The closing messages emphasize next steps for advisors reviewing the package and reinforce the educational value of the governance-first approach demonstrated throughout the notebook."],"metadata":{"id":"QktoO36gNwPN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"-qPlPvQYNhIv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10\n","# Goal: Create README and bundle all artifacts into downloadable zip\n","# Output: Zip file ready for download with complete supervision package\n","\n","# Create comprehensive README\n","readme_content = f\"\"\"# Chapter 3 - Level 3 Agentic Advisory Workflow Run\n","## Run ID: {RUN_ID}\n","## Generated: {datetime.now().isoformat()}\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER\n","NOT INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.\n","This package contains draft planning and communication assistance only.\n","Qualified advisor review and supervision required.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### GOVERNANCE SUMMARY\n","\n","**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 (Anthropic)\n","**Config Hash:** {MANIFEST['config_hash']}\n","**Temperature:** 0.2\n","**Max Tokens:** 4096\n","\n","---\n","\n","### CONTENTS\n","\n","📁 **Root Files:**\n","- `run_manifest.json` - Run metadata, model config, environment fingerprint\n","- `README.md` - This file\n","\n","📁 **logs/**\n","- `prompts_log.jsonl` - Immutable hash-chained audit trail (each entry links to previous)\n","- `risk_log.json` - Risk register with all flagged items across workflow\n","\n","📁 **deliverables/** (one subfolder per case)\n","Each case folder contains:\n","- `artifacts.json` - All agent outputs (intake, IPS, disclosure, suitability, QC, risk assessment)\n","- `registers.json` - Assumption register, open items register, not-verified register\n","- `checkpoints.json` - Human approval gate history with timestamps\n","\n","---\n","\n","### CASE EXECUTION SUMMARY\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Add case results\n","for cid, result in results.items():\n","    status = result.get('status', 'unknown')\n","    status_icon = \"✅\" if status == \"completed\" else \"⚠️\" if status == \"failed\" else \"🔄\"\n","    case_name = cid.replace('case_', '').replace('_', ' ').title()\n","    readme_content += f\"**{status_icon} {case_name}**\\n\"\n","    readme_content += f\"- Status: {status}\\n\"\n","    if status == \"completed\":\n","        readme_content += f\"- Artifacts: {result.get('artifacts_path', 'N/A')}\\n\"\n","        readme_content += f\"- Registers: {result.get('registers_path', 'N/A')}\\n\"\n","        readme_content += f\"- Checkpoints: {result.get('checkpoints_path', 'N/A')}\\n\"\n","    elif status == \"failed\":\n","        readme_content += f\"- Error: {result.get('error', 'Unknown error')}\\n\"\n","    readme_content += \"\\n\"\n","\n","readme_content += \"\"\"---\n","\n","### GOVERNANCE ARTIFACTS DETAIL\n","\n","✅ **Traceability**\n","- `run_manifest.json`: Complete run configuration and environment snapshot\n","- `prompts_log.jsonl`: Hash-chained immutable log prevents tampering\n","  - Each entry contains: step_id, agent_name, prompt_hash, response_hash, prev_hash\n","  - Chain integrity can be verified by checking prev_hash linkage\n","\n","✅ **Risk Register**\n","- `risk_log.json`: All risks detected during workflow execution\n","- Risk types tracked:\n","  - confidentiality (PII handling)\n","  - hallucination (invented facts/authority)\n","  - missing_facts (incomplete information)\n","  - suitability (suitability determination language)\n","  - regbi (Reg BI compliance language)\n","  - conflicts (conflict of interest gaps)\n","  - liquidity (liquidity mismatch)\n","  - prompt_injection (security issues)\n","  - overreach (scope boundary violations)\n","  - workflow_integrity_gap (missing checkpoints, structural issues)\n","  - hinge_fact_unresolved_block (critical facts blocking workflow)\n","\n","✅ **Assumption Registers**\n","- Per-case tracking of all assumptions made during workflow\n","- Hinge facts flagged (critical assumptions that block downstream steps if unresolved)\n","- Resolution status tracked for supervision review\n","\n","✅ **Checkpoint History**\n","- All human-in-the-loop approval gates logged with timestamps\n","- Auto-approval status recorded (in production, would require manual approval)\n","- Checkpoint names indicate workflow stage\n","\n","✅ **Immutable Audit Trail**\n","- Hash-chained log prevents post-hoc modification\n","- Redacted prompts/responses protect confidentiality while maintaining auditability\n","- Suitable for supervision files and regulatory examination\n","\n","---\n","\n","### LEVEL 3 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\n","\n","**Agentic Workflow Pattern:**\n","This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent orchestration pattern where:\n","1.

The pipeline represents a Level 3 agentic system where multiple AI agents collaborate through structured data exchanges, human checkpoints, and immutable logging to assist financial advisors while maintaining strict compliance boundaries. Understanding this pipeline reveals how modern AI can augment professional advisory work without replacing human judgment or violating regulatory requirements.\n","\n","**Stage 1: User Input - The Starting Point**\n","\n","The pipeline begins when a user provides an unstructured client scenario as plain text. This input might be a paragraph or several paragraphs describing a client situation, such as retirement planning needs, concentrated stock positions, alternative investment interests, or practice management challenges. The scenario typically includes facts like client age, asset values, goals, risk tolerance, and specific questions the advisor needs to address.\n","\n","This raw input is intentionally unstructured because that mirrors real-world advisory practice. Advisors receive information through conversations, emails, notes from meetings, or intake forms that vary in format and completeness. The AI system must be able to process this natural, unorganized information and transform it into something actionable.\n","\n","In Cell 9, four such scenarios are defined as simple Python strings. For example, Case 1 presents a retirement scenario with biographical details, asset information, income needs, pension details, Social Security considerations, risk concerns, health status, and planning questions all mixed together in narrative form. This messy, real-world format is what the pipeline must handle.\n","\n","**Stage 2: Intake Agent - Initial Structuring**\n","\n","The first transformation occurs when the OrchestratorAgent hands the raw scenario to the IntakeAgent. The orchestrator calls the intake agent's process method, passing the case identifier and the raw scenario text. The IntakeAgent then constructs a prompt for the Claude AI model.\n","\n","This prompt has two critical components. The system prompt defines the agent's role, boundaries, and output requirements. It states that the agent extracts facts, identifies assumptions, flags unknowns, never recommends investments, and must respond with valid JSON only. The user prompt contains the actual scenario text along with explicit instructions about what to extract and how to structure the response.\n","\n","Crucially, the prompt specifies the exact JSON schema required. The agent must return ten specific fields: task description, facts_provided list, assumptions list, alternatives list, open_questions list, analysis text, risks array, draft_output text, verification_status field, and questions_to_verify list. The prompt also specifies length constraints for each field to prevent token limit problems.\n","\n","**Stage 3: LLM Wrapper - Quality Control Gateway**\n","\n","Before the prompt reaches the Claude AI model, it passes through the StrictJSONLLMWrapper, which acts as a quality control gateway. The wrapper enhances the system prompt by injecting additional requirements about JSON formatting, length limits, and the mandatory disclaimer that must appear in all outputs.\n","\n","The wrapper then makes the API call to Anthropic's service using the configured model (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) with specified parameters: 4096 maximum tokens, 0.2 temperature for consistency, and the enhanced system and user prompts. The AI model processes these instructions and generates a response.\n","\n","When the response returns, the wrapper performs multiple validation steps before accepting it. First, it strips any markdown formatting that might have been included. Second, it attempts to parse the response as JSON. If parsing fails, the wrapper checks whether truncation occurred and can retry with more concise prompts. Third, it validates that all ten required fields are present in the parsed JSON. Fourth, it ensures array fields contain at least placeholder values if empty. Fifth, it runs pattern detection looking for problematic content like implied recommendations, suitability determinations, or unverified regulatory citations.\n","\n","If any validation fails, the wrapper logs the failure to the risk register and either retries or raises an error. If all validations pass, the wrapper logs the redacted prompt and response to the immutable audit trail using hash chaining, then returns the validated JSON structure to the calling agent.\n","\n","**Stage 4: JSON Processing - Data Registration**\n","\n","The IntakeAgent receives the validated JSON structure from the wrapper and returns it to the OrchestratorAgent. The orchestrator now processes this structured data by registering it into the SharedState system.\n","\n","The orchestrator iterates through the assumptions list, examining each assumption's text for keywords like \"critical\" or \"must\" that indicate it might be a hinge fact. Hinge facts are assumptions so important that if they remain unresolved, the workflow should not proceed to drafting recommendations. Each assumption gets registered with its hinge fact status.\n","\n","Similarly, the orchestrator extracts all items from the open_questions list and registers them as open items requiring follow-up. Items from the questions_to_verify list get registered into the not-verified register, flagging claims that need external validation.\n","\n","The complete intake artifact, with all ten JSON fields, gets stored in the case's artifacts collection within the shared state. This creates a permanent record of the intake step that later agents can reference.\n","\n","**Stage 5: Checkpoint Enforcement - Human Review Gates**\n","\n","After intake completes and data registration finishes, the orchestrator reaches Checkpoint 1. The checkpoint mechanism logs this moment with a timestamp, checkpoint name, case identifier, and approval status. In this demonstration, checkpoints auto-approve for smooth execution, but in production environments, these would pause the workflow requiring actual human review before proceeding.\n","\n","The orchestrator then calls the check_hinge_facts method on the shared state. This method examines the assumption register looking for any assumptions marked as hinge facts that remain unresolved. If unresolved hinge facts exist, the method logs a high-severity risk to the risk register and returns false, which causes the orchestrator to stop the workflow and finalize the case with a \"blocked by hinge facts\" status.\n","\n","If all hinge facts are resolved or no hinge facts exist, the workflow continues to the drafting agents.\n","\n","**Stage 6: Sequential Agent Processing - Building the Package**\n","\n","The orchestrator now executes agents sequentially, with each agent building on previous agents' work. The IPSDraftAgent receives the intake results as input. Rather than passing the raw scenario again, it receives the structured JSON from intake containing extracted facts and identified assumptions. The IPS agent uses these structured inputs to generate an Investment Policy Statement shell.\n","\n","The agent constructs its own prompt that references facts from the intake JSON. This prompt explicitly instructs the AI to create IPS sections (Purpose, Roles, Process, Review Schedule) without specifying allocations or targets. The prompt again requires the ten-field JSON structure with length limits.\n","\n","The wrapper processes this prompt through the same quality control pipeline: enhancement, API call, validation, pattern detection, logging, and return. The validated IPS JSON gets stored in the case artifacts.\n","\n","The DisclosureAgent follows the same pattern, receiving intake results and generating a disclosure checklist JSON. The SuitabilityReasoningAgent similarly processes intake data to create a structured reasoning scaffold with questions the advisor must answer.\n","\n","After these three drafting agents complete, Checkpoint 2 pauses for review of all draft materials before proceeding to quality control.\n","\n","**Stage 7: Quality Control and Risk Assessment**\n","\n","The QCReviewerAgent receives all accumulated artifacts as input. Rather than the raw scenario or intake results, it examines the complete collection: intake JSON, IPS JSON, disclosure JSON, and suitability JSON. The QC agent looks for gaps where information is missing, inconsistencies where different agents made conflicting assumptions, and risks that were not adequately addressed in earlier steps.\n","\n","The QC review outputs its findings in the same ten-field JSON structure. The risks array typically contains multiple entries identifying specific problems like \"missing retirement expense breakdown\" or \"concentration risk not addressed in disclosures.\" The draft_output field provides a summary of findings for the advisor to review.\n","\n","The RiskAssessorAgent then examines the entire workflow state, not just the artifacts. It receives the SharedState object giving it access to the assumption register, open items register, not-verified register, and checkpoint history. This agent evaluates whether the workflow itself was executed properly: Were all checkpoints completed? Are there too many unresolved assumptions? Did any agent skip required verification steps?\n","\n","The risk assessment JSON identifies workflow integrity issues, which are distinct from content issues. A workflow integrity problem might be \"multiple regulatory claims in disclosures but none flagged for verification\" or \"hinge fact identified but resolution not documented.\"\n","\n","After risk assessment completes, the Final Checkpoint requires approval before the package can be marked as ready for delivery.\n","\n","**Stage 8: Artifact Finalization - Creating Supervision Files**\n","\n","When the workflow completes (either successfully or by early termination at a checkpoint), the orchestrator's finalize method executes. This creates a subfolder within the deliverables directory named after the case identifier. Inside this folder, three JSON files are written.\n","\n","The artifacts.json file contains the complete output from all six agents: intake, IPS, disclosure, suitability, QC, and risk assessment. Each agent's ten-field JSON structure is preserved exactly as validated. This file provides the substantive content of the workflow - the actual drafts and analysis.\n","\n","The registers.json file contains three arrays extracted from the shared state: all assumptions with their hinge fact flags and resolution status, all open items identified throughout the workflow, and all not-verified claims that need external validation. This file helps supervisors understand what remains uncertain or unvalidated.\n","\n","The checkpoints.json file contains the complete history of checkpoint events: when each checkpoint occurred, whether it was auto-approved or manually approved, and which case it applied to. This provides audit evidence that human review gates were implemented.\n","\n","**Stage 9: Immutable Logging - Creating the Audit Trail**\n","\n","Parallel to the main workflow, the Logger class maintains two separate log files throughout execution. Every time an agent calls the LLM wrapper, the wrapper automatically calls the logger's log_prompt_response method after successful validation.\n","\n","This method creates a log entry containing the step identifier, timestamp, agent name, redacted prompt text, redacted response text, a hash of the prompt, a hash of the response, and critically, the hash of the previous log entry. This last field creates the hash chain that makes the log immutable.\n","\n","Each log entry is appended to the prompts_log.jsonl file as a single line of JSON. The jsonl format (JSON Lines) allows the file to grow without being loaded entirely into memory. The hash chain means that if anyone tried to modify an earlier entry, all subsequent entries' prev_hash values would no longer match, immediately revealing the tampering.\n","\n","Separately, whenever any component detects a risk (the wrapper detecting problematic patterns, the orchestrator finding unresolved hinge facts, or agents explicitly identifying risks in their outputs), an entry gets appended to the risk_log.json file. This file accumulates all risks from all cases in a single register, making it easy to review all problems in one place.\n","\n","**Stage 10: Package Assembly - Creating the Deliverable**\n","\n","After all cases complete execution, Cell 10 assembles the complete supervision package. The README generator creates comprehensive documentation by combining the run manifest, case results, governance explanations, supervision checklists, and technical details into a single 5000-word markdown document.\n","\n","The package_summary.json generator creates a machine-readable summary by extracting key information from the run manifest and case results into a structured JSON object. This allows automated tools to process packages without parsing markdown.\n","\n","The ZIP bundler recursively walks through the entire run directory and compresses all files while preserving folder structure. The resulting archive contains everything: manifest, README, summary, immutable logs, risk register, and individual case folders with their artifacts, registers, and checkpoint histories.\n","\n","**The Complete Pipeline in Summary**\n","\n","The pipeline transforms unstructured text into governed advisory artifacts through ten distinct stages. Raw scenarios become structured intake JSON through AI processing with quality controls. Structured intake feeds sequential specialized agents, each producing standardized JSON outputs. Human checkpoints gate progression between stages. Quality control agents examine accumulated artifacts for problems. All interactions get logged immutably with hash chaining. All risks get accumulated in a central register. All assumptions and open items get tracked in registers. All artifacts get saved in organized case folders. Everything gets packaged into a supervision-ready archive.\n","\n","This architecture demonstrates how generative AI can augment professional advisory workflows while maintaining the governance controls necessary for regulated industries. The strict JSON structuring at every stage ensures consistency, auditability, and scope enforcement. The multi-agent pattern allows specialization while maintaining coordination. The checkpoint mechanism preserves human primacy in decision-making. The immutable logging provides regulatory-grade audit trails. Together, these elements create a production-viable system that increases advisor productivity without compromising compliance or professional responsibility."],"metadata":{"id":"aV65a4QjNzQV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"3BdM6IPANlZ-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
