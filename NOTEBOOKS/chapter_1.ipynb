This casual back-and-forth works perfectly fine for personal tasks like planning a vacation, drafting a birthday message, or learning about a historical event. There are no consequences if the AI makes a mistake, no regulators reviewing your conversation history, and no legal liability if the information turns out to be wrong. You're just having a helpful chat with a smart computer program.\n","\n","But financial advisors operate in a completely different world. When you use AI to help draft a client email, create meeting notes, or explain a financial concept, you're not just having a casual conversation anymore. You're creating business records that may be subject to regulatory examination. You're working with confidential client information protected by privacy laws. You're operating in a highly regulated industry where the Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA, state regulators, and potentially the Department of Labor all have oversight authority. A single misstatement in a client communication could trigger compliance violations, regulatory scrutiny, or even legal liability.\n","\n","This is why financial services firms can't simply let advisors use consumer chatbots and hope for the best. The traditional chatbot interaction offers no audit trail, no governance controls, no boundary enforcement, and no protection against the AI overstepping its role. If an advisor pastes client information into a public chatbot, that data may be used to train future models, violating confidentiality obligations. If the AI suggests a specific investment or makes a recommendation, there's no automatic flag to catch that boundary violation. If the advisor needs to prove to a compliance officer exactly what they asked and what the AI responded six months ago, there's typically no comprehensive record. The casual chatbot interaction that works for consumers becomes a liability minefield for regulated professionals.\n","\n","This notebook represents a fundamentally different approach. Instead of a simple question-and-answer chatbot, we've built what might be called a \"governance-first AI drafting harness.\" Think of it as the difference between casually chatting with someone at a party versus conducting a recorded deposition with a court reporter present, exhibits marked and entered into evidence, and a complete transcript produced at the end. Both involve conversation, but the formality, documentation, and accountability are on entirely different levels.\n","\n","Here's what makes this system different from traditional chatbot interactions. First, everything is logged with cryptographic verification. Every single interaction with the AI is recorded in an immutable, hash-chained log that would reveal any tampering. When you send a prompt to Claude, the system captures not just what you asked but also computes a cryptographic hash—essentially a unique digital fingerprint—of that text. When Claude responds, that response gets its own hash. These hashes are chained together so each entry references the hash of the previous entry, creating an unbreakable audit trail. If a regulator or compliance officer asks what happened during a particular drafting session, you can produce a complete, verifiable record.\n","\n","Second, the system enforces strict boundaries that prevent the AI from overstepping its role. In a traditional chatbot, you rely entirely on the AI's training and your own vigilance to avoid problematic outputs. You might ask for help with a client situation and the AI might helpfully suggest specific investments, offer tax advice, or make definitive regulatory claims—all of which could be compliance violations. This system implements what we call \"Level 1 boundaries\" that are enforced at the architectural level, not just through hoping the AI behaves properly. Before any response is accepted, automated checks scan for recommendation language, invented regulatory authority, implied verification of unverified facts, and other red flags. If Claude tries to say \"you should allocate 60 percent to stocks\" or \"according to SEC regulations,\" those get flagged immediately for human review.\n","\n","Third, confidentiality protections are built into the workflow rather than being an afterthought. Before any text gets sent to Claude or written to logs, it passes through automated redaction that masks email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers, and other personally identifiable information. The system also scans for prompt injection attacks—malicious attempts to manipulate the AI by embedding commands like \"ignore previous instructions.\" While these automated protections aren't perfect and can't replace human judgment, they provide defense in depth that simply doesn't exist in casual chatbot interactions.\n","\n","Fourth, every output explicitly separates facts from assumptions and identifies open questions. One of the most dangerous aspects of AI is its tendency to fill in gaps with plausible-sounding information that may be completely wrong. In a traditional chatbot, the AI might confidently state something as fact when it's actually making an assumption based on incomplete information. This system forces Claude to explicitly declare what facts were provided, what assumptions it's making if any, and what questions remain unanswered. This \"facts versus assumptions\" separation helps prevent the advisor from inadvertently acting on hallucinated information.\n","\n","Fifth, the system produces comprehensive governance artifacts at the end of each session. Instead of just having some drafted text and vague memories of what you asked for, you receive a complete audit bundle including: a run manifest with configuration details and environmental fingerprint for reproducibility, the hash-chained prompts log, a risk register documenting every flagged issue with severity levels, all deliverables in both machine-readable and human-readable formats, and a detailed audit readme explaining how to verify and reproduce the work. If you need to demonstrate to compliance that you used AI responsibly, you have everything documented.\n","\n","The benefits of this approach for a regulated industry are substantial. From a compliance perspective, you have complete traceability and can demonstrate exactly what controls were in place. From a risk management perspective, automated boundary enforcement and risk flagging catch potential problems before they reach clients. From a supervision perspective, the built-in review checklists operationalize human oversight rather than leaving it as a vague requirement. From a professional liability perspective, the comprehensive documentation shows you exercised appropriate care and followed proper procedures.\n","\n","Perhaps most importantly, this approach changes the relationship between advisor and AI. In a traditional chatbot interaction, the AI is positioned as an authority that provides answers. In this governance-first system, the AI is explicitly positioned as a drafting assistant that helps structure communications while maintaining a \"not verified\" posture and requiring human review. Every output begins with the disclaimer \"NOT INVESTMENT, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE. For educational drafting assistance only. Qualified advisor review required.\" This framing helps prevent both advisors and clients from over-relying on AI-generated content.\n","\n","The system also implements what might be called \"capability-risk-controls alignment.\" As AI capabilities increase, risks increase proportionally, which requires increasing controls. This notebook implements Level 1 controls for Level 1 capabilities—simple drafting assistance. As you move to more sophisticated AI applications in future chapters—like reasoning engines that can analyze complex scenarios or agentic systems that can orchestrate multi-step workflows—the controls need to increase commensurately. But the foundation established here—immutable logging, boundary enforcement, risk flagging, and comprehensive audit trails—scales to those more sophisticated use cases.\n","\n","For financial advisors who want to leverage AI's efficiency benefits without creating compliance nightmares, this governance-first approach offers a path forward. You get the productivity gains of AI-assisted drafting—turning meeting notes into polished emails, creating client-friendly explanations of complex topics, generating discussion agendas—while maintaining the documentation, controls, and oversight that regulators expect. You're not just using a smarter chatbot; you're using a professionally architected system designed specifically for the requirements of regulated financial services.\n","\n","This is what responsible AI adoption looks like in financial services: not casual experimentation with consumer tools, but thoughtful implementation of governance-first systems that match controls to capabilities and produce the documentation needed to demonstrate professional competence."],"metadata":{"id":"6n-x0MLbMKUs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"HzSSYRQ0MKs8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 2\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Install + Imports + Run Directory\n","# Output: Print run directory path\n","\n","# Install Anthropic SDK\n","!pip install -q anthropic\n","\n","# Standard library imports\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","import hashlib\n","import platform\n","import subprocess\n","import uuid\n","from datetime import datetime, timezone\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from textwrap import wrap, dedent\n","\n","# Create timestamped run directory\n","timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","RUN_BASE_DIR = Path(\"/content/ai_finance_ch1_runs\")\n","RUN_DIR = RUN_BASE_DIR / f\"run_{timestamp}\"\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR = RUN_DIR / \"deliverables\"\n","\n","# Create directory structure\n","RUN_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"CELL 2: Installation + Directory Setup Complete\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(f\"✓ Anthropic SDK installed\")\n","print(f\"✓ Standard library modules imported\")\n","print(f\"✓ Run directory created: {RUN_DIR}\")\n","print(f\"✓ Deliverables directory created: {DELIVERABLES_DIR}\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)"],"metadata":{"id":"TOYUwL9vMKKC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768428735909,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":5673,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"fa25990e-46b6-45ee-aac9-4cbd0d8f7f3d"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["======================================================================\n","CELL 2: Installation + Directory Setup Complete\n","======================================================================\n","✓ Anthropic SDK installed\n","✓ Standard library modules imported\n","✓ Run directory created: /content/ai_finance_ch1_runs/run_20260114_221215\n","✓ Deliverables directory created: /content/ai_finance_ch1_runs/run_20260114_221215/deliverables\n","======================================================================\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.API AND CLIENT INITIALIZATION"],"metadata":{"id":"STtjBQgwMNHi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"ShWjt_vyMO17"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Cell 3: Setting Up Your Connection to Claude**\n","\n","This cell establishes the connection between your Google Colab notebook and Anthropic's Claude API, which is essential for all the AI-powered drafting features to work.\n","\n","First, the cell attempts to retrieve your Anthropic API key from Google Colab's secure Secrets storage. This is the recommended way to store sensitive credentials rather than pasting them directly into code where they could be accidentally shared. If the key is found, it gets loaded into the system's environment variables so the rest of the notebook can access it.\n","\n","If the API key cannot be found, you'll see clear, step-by-step instructions on how to add it to Colab Secrets. This includes clicking the key icon in the left sidebar, creating a new secret named ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, pasting your actual key, and enabling notebook access. These instructions make it easy for non-technical users to complete this critical setup step.\n","\n","Once the key is successfully loaded, the cell initializes the Anthropic client object, which is your gateway to making requests to Claude. Think of this like opening a phone line to Claude that will stay open for the duration of your session.\n","\n","The cell also sets three critical configuration parameters. The MODEL parameter specifies exactly which version of Claude you're using (Claude Sonnet 4.5). The TEMPERATURE parameter is set to 0.2, which is relatively low. Temperature controls randomness in the AI's responses - lower values produce more consistent, focused, predictable outputs, which is exactly what you want for professional financial communications. Higher temperatures would introduce more creativity and variation, but that's inappropriate for compliance-sensitive drafting.\n","\n","Most importantly, the MAX_TOKENS parameter is set to 4096. This defines the maximum length of Claude's responses. The original value of 1200 was too small and caused the JSON parsing failures you experienced - Claude would start generating a properly formatted response but get cut off mid-stream, creating invalid JSON. By increasing this to 4096, we give Claude enough space to complete full responses including disclaimers, open questions, risk assessments, and the actual drafted content.\n","\n","Finally, the cell prints a confirmation showing all these settings so you can verify everything is configured correctly before proceeding to use the drafting features.

Think of it as building the foundation and recordkeeping system before you start doing any actual work.\n","\n","The cell begins by defining several utility functions that will be used throughout the notebook. The now_iso function captures timestamps in a standard international format that includes timezone information, ensuring every action can be precisely dated. The sha256_text function creates cryptographic hashes, which are like unique digital fingerprints for pieces of text - if even one character changes, the entire hash changes, making them perfect for detecting tampering or verifying integrity. Additional utilities handle reading and writing JSON files and appending entries to log files.\n","\n","A particularly important function is get_env_fingerprint, which captures details about your computing environment including Python version, operating system, and installed packages. This environmental snapshot is crucial for reproducibility - if someone needs to recreate your results or verify your work months later, they'll know exactly what software versions you were using.\n","\n","The cell then defines BASE_CONFIG, which is essentially the constitution for this Level 1 system. It explicitly states what Level 1 means (single-turn drafting only, no complex reasoning, no agent orchestration), lists the specific model and parameters being used, and documents the governance principle that guides everything: capability increases risk, which requires increased controls. It also explicitly lists what is prohibited at Level 1, such as making investment recommendations or providing tax advice.\n","\n","This entire configuration gets hashed to create a config_hash, which is a unique identifier for this specific setup.

The run_manifest.json file contains all the metadata about your session including configuration, environment, timestamp, and author information. The prompts_log.jsonl file is initialized as an append-only log that will record every interaction with Claude using hash chaining for immutability - each entry contains a hash of itself and the previous entry, creating an unbreakable chain that would reveal any tampering.

Prompt injection is a technique where malicious users try to manipulate AI systems by embedding commands in their input, such as \"ignore previous instructions\" or \"reveal your system prompt.\" The function checks the user's input text against a library of known attack patterns including attempts to override instructions, extract system information, bypass safety controls, or inject malicious code. If it detects suspicious patterns, it flags them by type so appropriate security measures can be taken.\n","\n","The demonstration section shows all three utilities in action using synthetic test data. You can see exactly how an email gets masked, how a phone number becomes PHONE_REDACTED, and how the system would respond to both legitimate queries and malicious injection attempts. This transparency helps you understand both the capabilities and limitations of these automated protections."],"metadata":{"id":"ksHvcArXMxMR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###5.2.CODE AND

This is where Level 1 boundaries are enforced, JSON formatting is validated, and automated risk detection happens.\n","\n","The function begins by constructing a detailed system prompt that serves as Claude's instruction manual for this specific task. This prompt is absolutely critical because it defines what Claude can and cannot do. It explicitly lists the Level 1 boundaries: drafting assistance only, no investment recommendations, no product selection, no tax or legal conclusions. It then provides the exact JSON structure that Claude must return, with all required fields in a specific order.\n","\n","The most important part of the system prompt addresses the technical problem that caused your errors: multi-line strings in JSON. JSON requires all string values to be on a single line, but Claude naturally wants to format text with actual line breaks for readability. The prompt explicitly instructs Claude to use backslash-n (written as two characters: a backslash followed by the letter n) instead of actual line breaks. It even provides concrete examples showing the right way versus the wrong way to format multi-line content. This seemingly minor technical detail is what prevents the \"unterminated string\" errors you encountered.\n","\n","Before sending anything to Claude, the function runs your input through the redaction utility and the prompt injection scanner. If suspicious patterns are detected, they're immediately logged to the risk register. The function then makes the actual API call to Claude with your configured model, temperature, and token limit.\n","\n","When Claude's response comes back, the function attempts to parse it as JSON. First it strips away any markdown code fences that Claude might have added out of habit. If the JSON parsing succeeds, great. If it fails, the function doesn't give up immediately. Instead, it makes a second attempt with an even more explicit message explaining exactly what went wrong and how to fix it, essentially giving Claude a chance to correct its own formatting error.\n","\n","If both attempts fail, the function \"fails closed\" meaning it returns None rather than trying to work with invalid data. This failure is logged with full details including error messages and a preview of the malformed response. This fail-safe approach ensures bad data never propagates through your system.\n","\n","After successful parsing, the function runs a comprehensive set of automated risk checks on Claude's response. It scans for mentions of regulatory authorities like SEC or FINRA, which triggers a flag to verify those claims. It looks for recommendation language like \"you should buy\" or \"best fund\" which would violate Level 1 boundaries. It checks for implied verification claims. It examines whether sufficient open questions were identified, since too few questions might indicate Claude is making assumptions rather than acknowledging missing information.\n","\n","Every interaction is logged to the immutable hash-chained prompts log with redacted content, hashes, timestamps, and parsing status. All detected risks are written to the risk log with severity levels and case identifiers for traceability. Finally, a smoke test runs automatically to verify the entire system is working correctly before you start using it for real cases."],"metadata":{"id":"NbI8D2MMNp2V"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"HYi01MJHM25b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 6\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: LLM Wrapper: Strict JSON Drafting Call + Automated Risk Flags\n","# Output: Print \"LLM wrapper ready\" + smoke test returns valid JSON\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# LLM WRAPPER WITH STRICT JSON + AUTOMATED RISK DETECTION\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","# Global variable to track last entry hash for hash chaining\n","LAST_ENTRY_HASH = None\n","\n","def call_llm_strict_json(task_name, case_id, step_id, user_prompt, facts_bullets):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Call LLM with Level 1 boundary enforcement and strict JSON schema.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        task_name: Description of the drafting task\n","        case_id: Case identifier (e.g., \"case1\", \"exercise\")\n","        step_id: Step identifier (e.g., \"followup_email\", \"explainer\")\n","        user_prompt: Specific drafting instructions\n","        facts_bullets: List of fact strings provided by user\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        dict: Parsed JSON response with all required fields, or None if failed\n","    \"\"\"\n","    global LAST_ENTRY_HASH\n","\n","    # Build system prompt with Level 1 boundary enforcement\n","    system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a Level 1 drafting assistant for financial advisors.\n","\n","STRICT LEVEL 1 BOUNDARIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n","- You provide DRAFTING ASSISTANCE ONLY\n","- You NEVER make investment recommendations\n","- You NEVER select specific products, funds, or securities\n","- You NEVER make suitability determinations\n","- You NEVER provide tax or legal conclusions\n","- You NEVER make performance projections or guarantees\n","- You NEVER claim anything is \"verified\" unless explicitly stated in facts provided\n","\n","YOUR ROLE:\n","- Draft clear, client-friendly communications\n","- Summarize provided information\n","- Create question lists and discussion agendas\n","- Separate facts from assumptions\n","- Flag missing information as open questions\n","- Use \"Not verified\" posture for all regulatory/tax/legal content\n","\n","CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:\n","1.

Rather than forcing you to write detailed instructions from scratch every time you need Claude's help, these templates provide professionally structured prompts that already incorporate all the necessary guardrails and formatting requirements.\n","\n","The first template, meeting_followup_email, is designed to transform raw meeting notes into a polished follow-up email for clients. The template specifies that the tone should be warm and professional, appropriate for the advisor-client relationship. It instructs Claude to summarize the key discussion points, confirm any agreed-upon next steps, and keep the email concise at two to three paragraphs maximum. Critically, it explicitly prohibits making investment recommendations or suggesting specific products. This template is probably the most frequently used because every client meeting should have some form of documented follow-up.\n","\n","The second template, client_explainer, helps advisors create educational content that explains complex financial concepts in plain English. This is invaluable when clients ask about topics like concentration risk, sequence of returns, or liquidity constraints. The template emphasizes balanced explanation of risks and considerations without making suitability determinations. It specifically reminds Claude to focus on education rather than recommendation, ensuring the explanation teaches the client about a concept without telling them what to do about it. The template even suggests using analogies or examples to make abstract concepts more concrete.\n","\n","The third template, agenda_questions, helps prepare for upcoming client meetings by generating discussion agendas and fact-finding question lists. The template instructs Claude to create neutral discussion topics rather than recommendations, formulate open-ended questions that encourage dialogue, and organize related questions logically. It emphasizes gathering missing information needed for planning without presuming answers or making assumptions about the client's situation. A well-prepared agenda with thoughtful questions demonstrates professionalism and ensures important topics aren't overlooked during meetings.\n","\n","The fourth template, internal_sop, shifts from client-facing to internal documentation. It helps create standard operating procedure documents for training staff and maintaining consistent processes. The template focuses on process rather than investment advice, includes numbered steps with key controls and checkpoints, and references the need for supervisory review where applicable.\n","\n","Each template embeds the strict JSON formatting requirements so Claude knows exactly how to structure its response. The demonstration at the end of the cell shows one template in action using synthetic meeting notes, so you can see exactly what kind of output to expect. This includes not just the drafted content but also the metadata like how many open questions were identified and what the verification status is."],"metadata":{"id":"EKvlFydjNrmX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"X1KSLRldNBYW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 7\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Prompt Library: Level 1 Templates (Copy/Paste)\n","# Output: Print template names + show one example rendered with synthetic inputs\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# PROMPT LIBRARY -

I appreciated our discussion about your retirement timeline, income needs, and RMD planning considerations. I also noted your concern about sequence of returns risk as we think about your transition into retirement.\n","\n","As we discussed, our next steps are: (1) you'll gather your recent account statements for our review, and (2) I'll prepare income projection scenarios for us to discuss at our next meeting.

Each case generates multiple deliverables and creates a complete audit trail, showing both the capabilities and the governance controls in action.\n","\n","Case 1 focuses on retirement and distribution planning, one of the most common advisor conversations. The synthetic scenario involves a 64-year-old client nearing retirement who expressed concerns about sequence of returns risk and wants to discuss income needs and withdrawal strategies. For this case, the system generates four deliverables: a follow-up email summarizing the meeting, an action items list showing who needs to do what by when, a document separating confirmed facts from assumptions and listing open questions, and a risk notes file capturing any compliance flags triggered during generation. Each deliverable is saved in both JSON format for machine processing and plain text format for human reading.\n","\n","Case 2 addresses tax-aware planning with concentrated stock positions, a situation common among technology company employees. The scenario involves a 45-year-old client with 60 percent of net worth in employer stock who wants to discuss diversification. This case demonstrates how the system handles topics with significant tax implications without crossing the line into providing actual tax advice. The deliverables include a neutral discussion agenda, a client-friendly educational explainer about concentration risk, a list of questions the client should verify with their tax professional, and risk notes. Notice how the system helps structure the conversation and flags areas requiring specialist expertise rather than attempting to provide that expertise itself.\n","\n","Case 3 tackles alternative investments and illiquid assets like private credit or real estate funds. The scenario involves a 52-year-old client asking about these products, with mentions of liquidity constraints and lockup periods. This case is particularly interesting because alternative investments involve complex disclosures and suitability considerations. The deliverables include a risk and constraints questionnaire to assess client understanding, an educational explainer about liquidity and complexity, a list of disclosure placeholders showing what types of disclosures would be needed without inventing actual disclosure language, and risk notes. The disclosure placeholders approach is clever: instead of having Claude fabricate regulatory language which would be dangerous, it creates markers like \"INSERT FUND-SPECIFIC RISK DISCLOSURES\" that remind the advisor where actual disclosures must be inserted.\n","\n","Case 4 shifts focus entirely to internal practice management and staff training. Rather than client-facing content, this case demonstrates how the system can help create internal operational materials. The scenario involves training staff to use Level 1 AI tools safely. Deliverables include a one-page standard operating procedure, a review checklist for AI-drafted communications, and a quiz with answer key for testing staff understanding. This shows the system's versatility beyond just client communications.\n","\n","Throughout all four cases, important error handling is built in. If any generation fails due to JSON parsing errors or API issues, the system prints a warning that the deliverable was skipped rather than crashing or producing corrupted files. All risk flags are consolidated into case-specific risk notes files. At the end, a summary table displays key metrics for each case including how many open questions were identified, the highest risk severity detected, whether invented authority was flagged, and whether recommendation language was detected. This summary gives you an at-a-glance view of where potential compliance issues arose and which cases require extra scrutiny during human review."],"metadata":{"id":"UPGXnne7NtGW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###8.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"BIE5Ni_wNRvq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 8\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Run 4 Mini-Case Demos + Save Deliverables\n","# Output: Printed summary table + paths to case deliverables folders\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# MINI-CASE 1: RETIREMENT / DISTRIBUTION\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"RUNNING MINI-CASE 1: RETIREMENT / DISTRIBUTION\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","\n","case1_dir = DELIVERABLES_DIR / \"case1_retirement\"\n","case1_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","case1_facts = [\n","    \"Client: Robert Johnson (synthetic), age 64\",\n","    \"Meeting date: January 12, 2026\",\n","    \"Retirement target: 18-24 months from now\",\n","    \"Client expressed concern about sequence of returns risk\",\n","    \"Discussed need for income to cover estimated expenses\",\n","    \"Client aware of RMD requirements starting at age 73\",\n","    \"Mentioned interest in revisiting withdrawal rate assumptions\",\n","    \"No specific withdrawal strategy or products discussed\",\n","    \"Client to provide updated expense projections\"\n","]\n","\n","# Deliverable 1: Follow-up email\n","print(\"\\n[1/4] Generating follow-up email...\")\n","case1_followup = call_llm_strict_json(\n","    task_name=\"Draft follow-up email after retirement planning discussion\",\n","    case_id=\"case1\",\n","    step_id=\"followup_email\",\n","    user_prompt=PROMPT_TEMPLATES[\"meeting_followup_email\"],\n","    facts_bullets=case1_facts\n",")\n","if case1_followup:\n","    write_json(case1_dir / \"v001_followup_email.json\", case1_followup)\n","    # Optional plain text version\n","    with open(case1_dir / \"v001_followup_email.txt\", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","        f.write(case1_followup['draft_output'])\n","    print(\"✓ Saved: v001_followup_email.json/.txt\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"⚠️  SKIPPED: v001_followup_email.json (generation failed)\")\n","\n","# Deliverable 2: Action items\n","print(\"[2/4] Generating action items...\")\n","case1_actions = call_llm_strict_json(\n","    task_name=\"Extract action items from retirement planning meeting\",\n","    case_id=\"case1\",\n","    step_id=\"action_items\",\n","    user_prompt=\"Create a clear action items list with owner (client/advisor) and timeline for each item.

with Interactive Drafting Exercise**\n","\n","This cell transforms the notebook from a demonstration tool into an interactive workspace where you can practice using the AI drafting system with your own meeting notes. It provides a safe, structured environment to learn how the system works before using it with real client information.\n","\n","The cell begins with prominent warnings reminding you to use only synthetic or fully sanitized notes. These warnings appear multiple times because accidentally pasting real client information is one of the biggest risks when experimenting with new AI tools. The cell emphasizes that automated redaction has limits and cannot catch everything, so you must manually review your inputs first. It also reminds you that all inputs and outputs are business records that may be subject to regulatory retention requirements, so even practice exercises should be treated with appropriate care.\n","\n","The exercise creates a dedicated folder for your work separate from the pre-built case studies. By default, the cell includes demonstration notes about education planning for children as an example, but in actual practice you would replace this with your own sanitized meeting notes. The example shows realistic advisor content including discussion topics, timeline considerations, and follow-up items without any actual client identifiers.\n","\n","The cell then walks through a four-step security and generation process. Step one provides the meeting notes. Step two runs comprehensive security scanning including PII redaction, prompt injection detection, and minimum-necessary filtering. If any PII is detected during redaction, you receive immediate warnings showing exactly what was found and masked. If suspicious patterns suggesting prompt injection attacks are detected, you see alerts about those as well. This scanning happens before anything gets sent to Claude, providing defense in depth.\n","\n","Step three generates three distinct outputs. First, a follow-up email draft that summarizes the meeting in professional client-ready language. Second, an action items list that breaks down who needs to do what and when, formatted as a practical checklist. Third, and perhaps most importantly, an advisor review checklist customized to this specific conversation. This checklist reminds you to verify factual accuracy against your original notes, confirm no recommendations snuck through, check that disclaimers are present, ensure appropriate tone, scan for confidential information, and note recordkeeping requirements. This built-in review checklist is crucial because it operationalizes the human-in-the-loop principle by providing concrete steps rather than vague reminders to \"review carefully.\"\n","\n","Step four displays all the generated outputs with helpful formatting. You see excerpts from the drafted email, the action items, and the review checklist. The cell also shows metadata including how many open questions were identified and what the verification status is. If any high-severity risks were flagged during generation, they're displayed prominently with explanations of what triggered the flag and why it matters.\n","\n","The cell concludes with required next steps presented as an unchecked checklist. This reinforces that generating a draft is not the end of the process but rather the beginning of a careful review workflow. Each checkbox represents a specific verification task that must be completed before the content can be sent to a client. The final reminder in capital letters emphasizes that human review is absolutely mandatory, not optional."],"metadata":{"id":"7SgqchOZNupJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###9.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"q65FZs56NXZp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 9\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: User Exercise: Paste Sanitized Notes → Generate Draft + Review Checklist\n","# Output: Display draft outputs + file paths; warn if PII detected and show what was redacted\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# USER EXERCISE: INTERACTIVE DRAFTING WITH SANITIZED NOTES\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"CELL 9: USER EXERCISE - DRAFT FROM YOUR MEETING NOTES\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"\"\"\n","This exercise allows you to paste your own meeting notes (SANITIZED ONLY!)\n","and generate drafting assistance outputs.\n","\n","⚠️  CRITICAL REMINDERS:\n","  • Use ONLY synthetic or fully sanitized notes\n","  • Do NOT paste real client PII (names, SSNs, accounts, addresses)\n","  • Automated redaction has limits - review manually first\n","  • All inputs/outputs are business records subject to retention\n","\n","The exercise will generate:\n","  1.

Think of this as closing out a case file with all supporting documentation properly organized.\n","\n","The cell begins by creating an extensive audit readme file that serves as the instruction manual for anyone who needs to review or verify your work later. This could be you six months from now, a compliance officer conducting a review, or an auditor examining your firm's AI usage practices. The readme explains what each artifact in the bundle contains and why it matters. It describes the run manifest as containing configuration and environmental details, the prompts log as an immutable hash-chained record of interactions, the risk log as a register of flagged compliance issues, and the deliverables folder as structured outputs organized by case.\n","\n","A critical section of the readme explains how to verify the integrity of the audit trail. It describes how the hash chain in the prompts log provides mathematical proof that entries haven't been tampered with. Each entry contains a hash of itself and references the hash of the previous entry, creating an unbreakable chain. If someone altered even a single character in any log entry, the hash chain would break and reveal the tampering. The readme also explains how to verify the configuration hasn't changed by recomputing the config hash and comparing it to the stored value.\n","\n","The readme includes detailed instructions for reproducing your work. It lists the exact Python version, operating system, runtime environment, model identifier, temperature setting, and token limit used during this session. It explains that while exact response reproduction isn't guaranteed because large language models have inherent randomness, the behavior boundaries and governance controls should remain consistent across runs with the same configuration.\n","\n","Perhaps most valuable for practitioners, the readme provides a suggested supervision workflow as a checklist. This operationalizes human oversight by breaking it down into six concrete review categories: accuracy check comparing drafts to original inputs, boundary check confirming no recommendations or advice, compliance check verifying disclaimers and tone, risk review examining the risk log for high-severity flags, confidentiality check scanning for exposed sensitive information, and recordkeeping documentation. Each category has specific sub-tasks that transform vague instructions like \"review the output\" into actionable verification steps.\n","\n","After creating the readme, the cell generates a ZIP archive containing your entire run directory. This includes all logs, all deliverables, all risk registers, the manifest, and the readme itself. Before zipping, the cell creates a detailed file manifest showing every single file in the archive with its size in bytes. This transparency lets you see exactly what's being bundled and verify nothing is missing.\n","\n","The final output provides the complete ZIP file path and instructions for downloading it from Google Colab. It displays bundle statistics including total file count and size. Most importantly, it presents final reminders as a checklist of next steps. These reminders reinforce that downloading the bundle is just the beginning. You must review the audit readme for the supervision workflow, check the risk log for high-severity flags, complete human advisor review of all deliverables, retain everything per your firm's recordkeeping requirements, and never use AI-drafted content without qualified review. The cell ends with a clear statement that all outputs are drafts requiring human review, this is Level 1 assistance only and not investment advice, and the \"not verified\" posture must be maintained for all regulatory, tax, and legal content."],"metadata":{"id":"QktoO36gNwPN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"-qPlPvQYNhIv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Bundle + Audit README + Zip\n","# Output: Print zip filepath + checklist of included artifacts\n","\n","import shutil\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# CREATE AUDIT README\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"CELL 10: CREATING AUDIT BUNDLE\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","\n","# Load run_manifest for README generation\n","run_manifest = read_json(manifest_path)\n","\n","audit_readme_content = f\"\"\"\n","================================================================================\n","AUDIT README - LEVEL 1 AI DRAFTING HARNESS\n","Chapter 1: Chatbots for Financial Advisors\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Run ID: {RUN_ID}\n","Generated: {now_iso()}\n","Author: Alejandro Reynoso, Chief Scientist DEFI CAPITAL RESEARCH\n","        External Lecturer, Judge Business School Cambridge\n","Model: {MODEL}\n","\n","================================================================================\n","1.

In a traditional chatbot scenario, you would simply type your request into a text box and hope for useful results.\n","\n","But in this system, the first structured step is selecting the appropriate prompt template from the library. These templates aren't just convenience features—they encode professional best practices and compliance guardrails directly into the instructions that will guide Claude's behavior. When you select the meeting follow-up email template, for instance, you're not just choosing a format. You're activating a carefully crafted set of instructions that tell Claude to maintain a warm professional tone, summarize key points without making recommendations, keep the output concise, and explicitly avoid suggesting specific products or strategies. The template already includes the Level 1 boundary requirements and the strict JSON formatting rules, so you don't have to remember and retype those critical instructions every time.\n","\n","You then provide the factual inputs—your meeting notes, the client situation details, or whatever information Claude needs to complete the drafting task. This is where the first layer of protection activates. Before your input text goes anywhere near Claude's API, it passes through the redaction utility. This automated scanner looks for patterns that might indicate personally identifiable information: email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers, street addresses, and large dollar amounts that might reveal portfolio sizes. When it finds these patterns, it replaces them with placeholder tags like EMAIL_REDACTED or PHONE_REDACTED. Simultaneously, the prompt injection detector scans your input for suspicious patterns that might indicate an attack attempt—phrases like \"ignore previous instructions\" or \"reveal your system prompt.\" If detected, these get logged immediately as high-severity security risks.\n","\n","**Stage Two: Structuring the Request**\n","\n","Your natural language input and the selected template now need to be transformed into a structured request that can be sent to Claude's API. This is where the call_llm_strict_json function takes over, and this is the first major architectural difference from traditional chatbots.\n","\n","The function constructs two distinct messages that will be sent to Claude. The first is the system prompt, which serves as Claude's instruction manual for this specific task. This isn't a casual suggestion—it's a detailed specification of boundaries, requirements, and formatting rules. The system prompt explicitly lists what Claude can and cannot do at Level 1, provides the exact JSON schema that must be returned with all fields in a specific order, and includes critical technical instructions about how to handle multi-line text in JSON format. Remember, JSON requires all string values to be on single lines, but Claude naturally wants to format readable text with actual line breaks. The system prompt teaches Claude to use backslash-n as an escape sequence instead of actual line breaks, providing concrete examples of correct versus incorrect formatting. This seemingly technical detail is what prevents the \"unterminated string\" errors that would cause the entire process to fail.\n","\n","The second message is the user prompt, which combines your specific task description with the factual information Claude needs. This gets structured as a clear task statement followed by bulleted facts derived from your input. The structure itself communicates important information: these are the facts you've provided, this is what you're asking for, and Claude should not invent additional facts or make assumptions beyond what's explicitly stated.\n","\n","Before this structured request gets sent to Claude's API, the system computes cryptographic hashes of both the prompt and (once received) the response. These hashes serve as digital fingerprints that will later enable verification that nothing was altered. The current timestamp gets captured, and the system prepares to link this new log entry to the previous one in the hash chain, ensuring immutability of the audit trail.\n","\n","**Stage Three: API Interaction and Response Handling**\n","\n","The structured request now goes out to Anthropic's Claude API over HTTPS with your API key for authentication. The system sends the exact model identifier (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929), the temperature parameter (0.2 for consistency), and the maximum token limit (4096 to ensure Claude has enough space to complete responses). This is a synchronous API call, meaning the notebook waits for Claude to process the request and return a response.\n","\n","When Claude's response arrives, it comes back as text that should be valid JSON containing all the required fields: task description, facts provided, assumptions made, open questions, analysis, risks, draft output, verification status, and questions to verify. But here's where things get interesting—Claude might have wrapped the JSON in markdown code fences out of habit, or might have included comments, or might have inadvertently created multi-line strings that break JSON parsers.\n","\n","The response handling is therefore defensive and multi-layered. First, the system attempts to clean the response by stripping markdown code fences from the beginning and end. Then it tries to parse the cleaned text as JSON. If parsing succeeds, excellent—we have valid structured data. But if parsing fails, the system doesn't give up or panic. Instead, it enters a retry protocol specifically designed to recover from formatting errors.\n","\n","The retry mechanism sends Claude a new message explaining exactly what went wrong—including the specific JSON parsing error—and provides explicit instructions on how to fix it. This message emphasizes keeping all strings on single lines, using backslash-n for line breaks, removing markdown and comments, and returning only the JSON object. Claude gets a second chance to reformat the same content correctly. If this retry succeeds, the system notes in the logs that parsing succeeded after retry, which is valuable diagnostic information. If the retry also fails, the system \"fails closed\"—it returns None rather than attempting to work with corrupted data, and it logs a high-severity risk entry with details about both parsing failures and a preview of the malformed response.\n","\n","**Stage Four: Automated Risk Detection and Validation**\n","\n","Assuming we now have valid parsed JSON, the system doesn't simply hand it back to you and call it done. This is where the automated risk detection pipeline activates, implementing multiple layers of compliance and quality checks.\n","\n","The invented authority detector scans Claude's response text for mentions of regulatory bodies: SEC, FINRA, IRS, ERISA, Department of Labor, and others. If found, this triggers a medium-severity risk flag reminding you to verify any regulatory claims because Claude cannot actually confirm what current regulations require. The recommendation language detector uses pattern matching to look for phrases that suggest investment advice: \"you should buy,\" \"best fund,\" \"optimal allocation,\" \"guaranteed returns.\" If detected, this triggers a high-severity risk flag because providing recommendations violates Level 1 boundaries and potentially creates compliance exposure. The implied verification detector looks for language suggesting that facts have been confirmed when they haven't been: \"verified,\" \"confirmed,\" \"validated,\" or statements like \"according to SEC regulations.\" Finding these patterns triggers a medium-severity flag.\n","\n","The missing facts detector examines the open_questions field in the parsed JSON. If Claude identified fewer than two open questions, this might indicate it's operating on insufficient information or making assumptions to fill gaps. This triggers a low-severity flag as a quality concern. The confidentiality checker looks for redaction markers in the draft output—if the draft contains EMAIL_REDACTED or similar tags, this suggests potentially problematic data handling that needs review.\n","\n","Each detected risk gets logged to the risk register as a separate entry with the run ID, case ID, step ID, timestamp, risk type, severity level, and explanatory note. This granular logging means you can later review exactly what concerns were raised about each specific deliverable rather than just having a vague sense that \"something might be wrong.\"\n","\n","**Stage Five: Immutable Logging and Hash Chaining**\n","\n","Simultaneously with risk detection, the logging pipeline creates an immutable record of this interaction. A log entry gets constructed containing the run ID, case ID, step ID, unique entry ID, timestamp, redacted versions of both the prompt and response (truncated if very long), cryptographic hashes of the full prompt and response, the hash of the previous log entry, model parameters, and parsing status.\n","\n","Then comes the crucial step that creates immutability: computing the entry hash. The system concatenates the entry ID, prompt hash, response hash, and previous entry hash into a single string, then computes the SHA-256 hash of that concatenated string. This becomes the current entry's hash, which will be referenced by the next entry's \"previous entry hash\" field. This creates a cryptographic chain where altering any single entry would break the chain and reveal tampering. The entry gets appended to the prompts log JSONL file—a format where each line is a separate JSON object, making it easy to process programmatically while maintaining append-only integrity.\n","\n","**Stage Six: Deliverable Creation and Versioning**\n","\n","With validation complete and logging recorded, the system now saves the actual deliverable. The parsed JSON gets written to a file in the appropriate case directory with version-controlled naming: v001_followup_email.json. This JSON file contains all the metadata—the task description, facts, assumptions, open questions, analysis, risks, verification status, and questions to verify—along with the actual draft_output field containing the generated text.\n","\n","For human readability, the system often also extracts just the draft_output field and writes it to a parallel plain text file: v001_followup_email.txt. This gives you an easy-to-read version for quick review while preserving the full structured metadata in the JSON format for audit and analysis purposes. Both files are timestamped and organized by case, making it easy to locate specific deliverables later.\n","\n","The risk entries specific to this deliverable get consolidated into a case-specific risk notes file, providing a focused view of concerns rather than requiring you to search through the entire session's risk log. This organizational structure mirrors professional document management practices where related materials are kept together.\n","\n","**Stage Seven: Comprehensive Audit Package Assembly**\n","\n","After all cases and exercises are complete, the final cell assembles everything into a comprehensive audit bundle. This isn't just copying files into a folder—it's creating a professional archive with extensive documentation.\n","\n","The audit readme gets generated as a substantial text document explaining what each artifact is, how to verify the hash chain integrity, how to reproduce the run configuration, what Level 1 boundaries mean, what supervision workflow is recommended, what disclaimers and limitations apply, and where to seek support. This readme transforms a collection of technical artifacts into a comprehensible package that compliance officers, auditors, or future versions of yourself can understand months or years later.\n","\n","The file manifest gets created by recursively scanning the entire run directory and cataloging every single file with its path and size. This manifest provides transparency about exactly what's included in the archive and enables verification that nothing is missing. The total file count and size get computed, giving you a sense of the audit trail's scope.\n","\n","Finally, everything gets compressed into a single ZIP archive named with the run ID for easy identification. The ZIP format is universally supported and creates a portable package that can be downloaded, archived, shared with compliance, or attached to regulatory responses as needed.\n","\n","**Stage Eight: Human Review and Professional Judgment**\n","\n","The final and most critical stage happens entirely outside the automated system: your review and professional judgment as a qualified financial advisor. The system concludes by presenting you with explicit checklists of required next steps—not vague suggestions but specific verification tasks.\n","\n","You must compare drafts against original inputs for accuracy. You must confirm no recommendations snuck through despite the automated checks. You must verify that tone and language align with your firm's standards and the specific client relationship. You must review the risk log for high-severity flags and address them appropriately. You must check that confidential information hasn't leaked through despite redaction. And you must document your review and retain all artifacts per your firm's recordkeeping policies.\n","\n","This human-in-the-loop requirement isn't a limitation of the system—it's a deliberate design principle. The governance-first architecture creates comprehensive documentation, enforces boundaries, flags risks, and structures outputs, but it explicitly positions all AI-generated content as drafts requiring qualified professional review. The system gives you powerful tools while maintaining clear accountability: you remain responsible for everything that goes to clients under your name.\n","\n","**The Complete Pipeline: Why Structure Matters**\n","\n","Tracing this complete pipeline from unstructured user input through structured API requests, defensive response handling, automated risk detection, immutable logging, deliverable creation, and comprehensive audit assembly reveals why this approach differs fundamentally from casual chatbot interactions.\n","\n","Every stage serves a specific governance purpose. Redaction protects confidentiality. Structured prompts enforce boundaries. Defensive parsing prevents failures. Automated risk detection catches compliance concerns. Immutable logging creates verifiable audit trails. Comprehensive packaging supports regulatory examination. Required checklists operationalize human oversight.\n","\n","The JSON format isn't just a technical implementation detail—it's the structural foundation that makes everything else possible. By requiring Claude to return structured data with explicit separation of facts, assumptions, questions, analysis, risks, and output, we transform an opaque black box into a transparent, auditable, controllable system. The structure enables automated validation, risk detection, and quality checks that would be impossible with unstructured text responses.\n","\n","For financial advisors operating in regulated environments, this structured, governance-first pipeline provides what casual chatbots cannot: comprehensive documentation, boundary enforcement, risk management, and professional accountability. You get AI's efficiency benefits while maintaining the controls, oversight, and audit trails that regulators expect and professional standards require.\n","\n","This is the future of AI in regulated industries—not replacing human judgment with automation, but augmenting professional expertise with structured, controllable, auditable AI assistance that respects both the power and the limitations of these remarkable tools."],"metadata":{"id":"aV65a4QjNzQV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10\n","# Type: Code\n","# Goal: Bundle + Audit README + Zip\n","# Output: Print zip filepath + checklist of included artifacts\n","\n","import shutil\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# CREATE AUDIT README\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","print(\"CELL 10: CREATING AUDIT BUNDLE\")\n","print(\"=\" * 70)\n","\n","# Load run_manifest for README generation\n","run_manifest = read_json(manifest_path)\n","\n","audit_readme_content = f\"\"\"\n","================================================================================\n","AUDIT README - LEVEL 1 AI DRAFTING HARNESS\n","Chapter 1: Chatbots for Financial Advisors\n","================================================================================\n","\n","Run ID: {RUN_ID}\n","Generated: {now_iso()}\n","Author: Alejandro Reynoso, Chief Scientist DEFI CAPITAL RESEARCH\n","        External Lecturer, Judge Business School Cambridge\n","Model: {MODEL}\n","\n","================================================================================\n","1.
